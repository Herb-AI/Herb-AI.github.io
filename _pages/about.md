When writing research software we almost always investigate highly specific properties or algorithms of our domain, leading to us building the tools from scratch over and over again. The very same is true for the field of program synthesis: tools are hard to run, benchmarks are hard to get and prepare, and it is hard to adapt our existing code to a novel idea.

Herb.jl will take care of this for you and help you to define, solve, and extend your program synthesis problems.

Herb.jl provides...
- a unified and universal framework for program synthesis
- a fast notion to describe all sorts of program synthesis problems with different specifications and grammars
- many state-of-the-art benchmarks and solvers already implemented and usable out-of-the-box

Check out [our documentation](https://herb-ai.github.io/Herb.jl/dev/) and [the repository](https://github.com/Herb-AI/Herb.jl).

### Try it out!

For anyone new to program synthesis, we offer [tutorials](https://herb-ai.github.io/Herb.jl/dev/get_started/) to get you familiar with program synthesis within Herb.jl.

To those of you already familiar with program synthesis, we invite you to check out our [Garden](https://github.com/Herb-AI/Garden) where we have implemented some well-known synthesizers within Herb.jl, so you can easily benchmark against them.
