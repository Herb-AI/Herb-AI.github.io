When writing research software we almost always investigate highly specific properties or algorithms of our domain, leading to us building the tools from scratch over and over again. The very same holds for the field of program synthesis: Tools are hard to run, benchmarks are hard to get and prepare, and its hard to adapt our existing code to a novel idea.

Herb.jl will take care of this for you and helps you defining, solving and extending your program synthesis problems.

Herb.jl provides...
- a unified and universal framework for program synthesis
- Herb.jl allows you to describe all sorts of program synthesis problems using context-free grammars
- a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks and solvers already implemented and usable out-of-the-box

Check out [our documentation](https://herb-ai.github.io/Herb.jl/dev/) and [the repository](https://github.com/Herb-AI/Herb.jl).
